                        "Most smile makeovers include porcelain veneers. Placing the veneers on top of your teeth without altering them would make the veneers stand out from the neighboring teeth. To avoid this issue, the enamel of the teeth is conditioned to accommodate the veneers. This process is known as enameloplasty.",

                        "It can take a few days for your permanent veneers to be completed. In the meantime, temporary veneers will be placed and you will wear these until your follow-up appointment. Temporary veneers are usually crafted from a composite resin that uses your impressions as a guide. Your temporaries should give you a good idea of how your permanent veneers will look.",

            question: "What are Lumineers?",
            plainAnswer:
                "Lumineers refer to a brand of no-prep veneers that are crafted from thin pieces of laminate. These are so thin that the teeth do not need to undergo a shaving process before they are applied. Lumineers are also semi-translucent. Therefore, if your teeth have dark stains, Lumineers may not be the best option. Most Lumineers last anywhere from 10 to 20 years. In some instances, Lumineers may require several appointments. During your first appointment the dentist will take impressions of your teeth. On the follow-up appointment your Lumineers will be placed.",

            plainAnswer:
                "Dental insurance often covers a portion or all of the cost of procedures that are deemed medically necessary. Many restorative treatments not only improve your oral health, but also the appearance of your smile. Before any treatments begin, we will advise you on what procedures are covered by insurance and which may not.",

            question: "How Long Does it Take to Have a Smile Makeover?",
            plainAnswer:
                "The average is two visits with your dentist. Some smiles can be corrected in just one visit while others may require up to three visits with the dentist. The number of visits required to achieve your smile will depend on the type of procedures chosen and the state of your oral health.",

            question: "Is the Process Painful?",
            plainAnswer:
                "A majority of cosmetic treatments cause very little pain or discomfort. During some procedures, a local anesthetic will be applied to minimize any discomfort and to ensure you are comfortable throughout the process. If you have dental anxieties, we can also recommend a form of conscious sedation such as nitrous oxide.",
